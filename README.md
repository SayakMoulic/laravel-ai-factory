## Usage

Using Laravel AI Factory is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Creating a Factory**:

   Create a new factory using the Artisan command:

   ```bash
   php artisan make:factory UserFactory
   ```

2. **Defining the Factory**:

   In your `UserFactory.php`, you can define fields like this:

   ```php
   use SayakMoulic\LaravelAiFactory\AiFactory;

   class UserFactory extends AiFactory
   {
       protected $model = User::class;

       public function definition()
       {
           return [
               'name' => $this->ai()->generate('name'),
               'email' => $this->ai()->generate('email'),
               'password' => bcrypt('password'),
           ];
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Generating Data**:

   You can generate data using:

   ```php
   User::factory()->count(10)->create();
   ```

   This will create 10 users with realistic names and emails generated by AI.

## Configuration

The package comes with a configuration file located at `config/laravel-ai-factory.php`. You can customize the following options:

- **AI Model**: Specify which AI model to use for generating data.
- **Field Definitions**: Define any custom fields you want to generate.
- **Insert Mode**: Choose between bulk or individual inserts.

## Examples

### Generating Users

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to generate users with both AI-generated and manually defined fields:

```php
use App\Models\User;

User::factory()->count(5)->create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => $this->ai()->generate('email'),
]);
```

### Bulk Insertion

To insert multiple records in one go, you can do:

```php
User::factory()->count(50)->create();
```

This will generate and insert 50 users into your database.
